# Merriweather Font Installation Status - AR Sketch Tracer

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED TASKS

### 1. Font File Downloads
- ‚úÖ Downloaded Merriweather Variable Font files from Google Fonts
- ‚úÖ Files located in: `Resources/Fonts/`
  - `Merriweather-VariableFont_opsz,wdth,wght.ttf`
  - `Merriweather-Italic-VariableFont_opsz,wdth,wght.ttf`

### 2. Info.plist Configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated `Info.plist` with correct UIAppFonts array
- ‚úÖ Font file names properly referenced for bundle loading

### 3. Typography System
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive typography scale in `DesignSystem/Tokens/Typography.swift`
- ‚úÖ Implemented font scaling with system fallbacks
- ‚úÖ Typography tokens: title, headline, subtitle, body, button, caption, footnote

### 4. Design System Integration
- ‚úÖ Updated color tokens to use correct naming convention
- ‚úÖ Fixed compilation errors in ContentView.swift
- ‚úÖ Project builds successfully

### 5. Build System
- ‚úÖ Project compiles without errors
- ‚úÖ All design system components properly integrated

## ‚ö†Ô∏è  PENDING TASK

### Font Bundle Integration
**Issue**: Font files exist in `Resources/Fonts/` but are **NOT** added to the Xcode project as bundle resources.

**Result**: Fonts are configured in `Info.plist` but won't be loaded at runtime because they're not included in the app bundle.

## üîß FINAL STEP REQUIRED

### Add Fonts to Xcode Project Bundle

You need to manually add the font files to the Xcode project:

1. **Open Xcode**: `ARSketchTracer.xcodeproj` is already open
2. **Navigate to Resources folder** in Xcode Project Navigator
3. **Right-click** on the `Resources` folder
4. **Select** "Add Files to ARSketchTracer"
5. **Navigate** to `Resources/Fonts/` folder
6. **Select both .ttf files**:
   - `Merriweather-VariableFont_opsz,wdth,wght.ttf`
   - `Merriweather-Italic-VariableFont_opsz,wdth,wght.ttf`
7. **Ensure** "Add to target: ARSketchTracer" is checked
8. **Click** "Add"

### Verification

After adding the fonts to Xcode:

1. **Build the project**: Should build successfully ‚úÖ (already working)
2. **Run the app** in iOS Simulator
3. **Navigate** to "Font Test" screen
4. **Verify** Merriweather fonts appear in the available fonts list
5. **Check** that text displays with Merriweather typography

## üõ†Ô∏è TESTING TOOLS

### Font Checker Script
Run the font installation checker:
```bash
./check_fonts.sh
```

This script will verify:
- ‚úÖ Font files exist in Resources/Fonts/
- ‚úÖ Info.plist configuration
- ‚ùå Xcode project bundle inclusion (currently failing)
- ‚úÖ Project build status

### Font Test Screen
- **Access**: Launch app ‚Üí tap "Font Test" button
- **Purpose**: Shows available fonts and typography scale examples
- **Expected**: Merriweather should appear in available fonts list once bundle integration is complete

## üìä CURRENT STATUS

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Font Files | ‚úÖ Downloaded | Variable fonts in Resources/Fonts/ |
| Info.plist | ‚úÖ Configured | UIAppFonts array properly set |
| Typography System | ‚úÖ Complete | DS.Typography tokens implemented |
| Design System | ‚úÖ Integrated | Colors, spacing, all components working |
| Project Build | ‚úÖ Success | No compilation errors |
| **Bundle Integration** | ‚ùå **Pending** | **Fonts not added to Xcode project** |
| Font Loading | ‚ùå Pending | Will work once bundle integration complete |

## üéØ NEXT ACTION

**You need to complete the bundle integration step above.** Once that's done:

1. The Merriweather fonts will load at runtime
2. All typography will render with the custom font family
3. The Font Test screen will show Merriweather in available fonts
4. Your AR Sketch Tracer app will have beautiful Merriweather typography! ‚ú®

## üîç WHY THIS STEP IS MANUAL

iOS requires font files to be included as bundle resources in the Xcode project. While we can automate many things via command line, adding files to an Xcode project's bundle requires either:
1. Manual addition through Xcode GUI (recommended)
2. Complex pbxproj file manipulation (error-prone)

The manual approach ensures the files are properly added with correct target membership and build settings.

**Almost there! Just need to add those fonts to the Xcode project bundle and you'll be all set! üöÄ**
