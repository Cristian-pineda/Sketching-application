# Font Placeholder

This directory should contain the Merriweather font files:

- Merriweather-Regular.ttf
- Merriweather-Bold.ttf  
- Merriweather-Medium.ttf
- Merriweather-Italic.ttf
- Merriweather-BoldItalic.ttf

**Important**: The actual .ttf files are not included in this repository due to licensing considerations. Please download them from Google Fonts as described in the README.md file.

After adding the font files:
1. Add them to the Xcode project
2. Ensure they're included in the ARSketchTracer target
3. The fonts will be automatically used by the design system
